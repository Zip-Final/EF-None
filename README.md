# EF-None
EF-None is an application that takes a user's location and tells you the percentage chance of a tornado in an area based off of the latitude and longitude as well as the month range. Our application was built using Python, Flask, Pandas, and geopy for the server and logic, with the front end using Leaflet to display an interactive map.
